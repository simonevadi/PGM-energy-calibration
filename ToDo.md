At the moment I am not using, to calculate alpha and beta and theta, the formulas given in the paper. I already had some others implemented in python, but since I have an energy shift I would like to compare them.

I have to check how to do the fit including the orders. what I understood is that I either do a multivariate fit, or i divide the energy by the order if I want to do a linera fit
